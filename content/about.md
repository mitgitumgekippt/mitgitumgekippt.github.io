### Who is this?
I am Moritz and I like tech. Currently I am mostly working on cyber security topics (shh, between us: it will be topic in the first post...), but I also did some stuff with microelectrocis (Arduino and ESP8266). I studied CS @ Saarland University and I am currently open for work!

When I not on the PC, then I am running trails or I debate in a debating club! 

### Contact

I am reachable via `hier_ist_moritz [at] t-online.de`. 
Of course I also have a [GPG Key](/moritzGPGpublic.asc)!
