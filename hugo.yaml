      - I am Moritz and welcome to yet another tech-blog! In the next few weeks, you will find some articles, mainly about cybersecurity and the open-source world! The first one will either be a small CTF write-up of a [saarCTF](https://ctf.saarland) challenge I wrote (of course after the event) or  a little rant about note-taking applications. I hope you have as much fun as I have!
